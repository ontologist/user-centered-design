# HR AI Assistant - User-Centered Design Requirements Gathering

This website serves as the central hub for our user-centered design process for the HR AI Assistant project.

## Project Overview

We're developing an AI-powered HR assistant that integrates with Workday and existing systems to provide contextual, role-appropriate support to employees, managers, and HR administrators.

## Website Structure

- **Home**: Project overview and design thinking process introduction
- **Project Context**: Current challenges, scope, and background
- **Stakeholders**: Stakeholder analysis and user personas
- **Design Process**: 5-phase design thinking methodology
  - Phase 1: Empathize
  - Phase 2: Define
  - Phase 3: Ideate
  - Phase 4: Prototype
  - Phase 5: Implement
- **Templates**: Ready-to-use templates for user research and requirements gathering
- **Resources**: Best practices, frameworks, and recommended reading

## Design Thinking Approach

This project follows a strict user-centered design process to ensure we build the right solution for the right users:

1. **Empathize**: Understand users through interviews, observations, and journey mapping
2. **Define**: Synthesize findings into clear problem statements and user needs
3. **Ideate**: Generate creative solutions and prioritize features based on user value
4. **Prototype**: Build testable versions and gather user feedback iteratively
5. **Implement**: Roll out with training, support, and continuous improvement

## Key Principles

- User needs drive features, not system capabilities
- Document everything to prevent scope creep
- Early stakeholder engagement reduces miscommunication
- Iterative approach: build, test, learn, refine
- Trade-off transparency in all communications

## Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages and serves as the official requirements documentation for the project.
